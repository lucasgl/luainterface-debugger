This project is a debugger extension for LuaInterface.
It raises the built in Lua debug interface to a higher level.
Interaction with the debugger is done by events and method calls.

Fore more information see the featured Wiki pages to the right.

LuaInterface is a bridge between Lua and the CLR.
To use the LuaDebugger you need at least LuaInterface version 2.0.2 (which will be available soon) or you get at least [revision 4](https://code.google.com/p/luainterface-debugger/source/detail?r=4) from the LuaInterface svn repository at google code.

LuaInterfae is hosted at:

## IDE for LuaInterface Debugger ##
**12/23/2008 - rostermeier**

I'm currently working on an IDE for LuaDebugger.
The core is a project called CustomIDE which provides nothing more then the framework and an text editor.
By extensions you can build in more functionallity.
By this I add Lua editing and debugging to it.
This will not be a standalone tool but you can embed it to any of your .NET applications.
The release is sheduled for "when it's done".
If any one is intersted: let me know, then I might provide some kind of CTP earlier.
