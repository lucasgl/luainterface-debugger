#Usage of LuaInterface-debugger.

= Introduction =

This page should give you a short overview on how to use the LuaInterface-debugger.

= Details =

First of all you need to use the correct namespaces:
{{{
using LuaInterface;
using LuaInterface.Debugger;
}}}

Next you have to create an instance of LuaInterface and LuaInterface-debugger,
and handle the necessarry events.
{{{
Lua lua = new Lua();
lua.HookException += Lua_HookException;

LuaDebugger debugger = new LuaDebugger(lua);
debugger.Stoping += Debugger_Stoping;
debugger.WaitingForAction += Debugger_WaitingForAction;
}}}
Create a instance of Lua as always or use an existing one.
You should handle the Lua.HookException event, in case that any Exceptions are thrown inside your debug code.
Then create a instance of LuaDebugger and pass your lua interpreter to it in the constructor.
